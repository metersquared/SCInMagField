### Tight binding Hamiltonian with magnetic field


The tight binding Hamiltonian with Peierls substitution can be generated with `normalMetalRectangularCell(in)`.




`in `is a structure consisting of elements:




`Nx, Ny - System lengths`




`chemPot - Chemical potential`




`hopInt - Hopping integral`




`b - Magnetic field strength scaled with `$2\pi$




`impurityArray - An array of potential impurities, major order along x`


  


Generate data (`EN200x25.mat`) of eigenvalues across different values of magnetic field `b` in a for-loop for different Hamiltonian with `testRectangular.m`.




Plotting eigenenergy against normalized magnetic field strength alpha gives us the Hofstadter's butterfly.
